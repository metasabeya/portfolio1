One of the latest major trends across the web industry is the increase in responsive web design â€“ where websites were designed to respond to the size of the browser and change their layout accordingly. Responsive design requires designers to write code that inspects the physical characters of whatever device is displaying the content, using things like media queries. This gives users across different devices a fluid, consistent experience.

Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD. Content, design and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction.Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic..Responsive web design is an example of user interface plasticity.
